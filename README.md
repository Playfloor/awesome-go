# Awesome Go 1.18+ Modules

My personal list of *truly* awesome Go 1.18+ modules (even if a lot of
them are mine). Many "awesome" lists are, um, less than than awesome. I
curate this list myself and do not accept pull requests. I am, however,
open to suggestions if you'd like to open an issue. (Roughly ordered by
level of awesomeness.)

* [rwxrob/bonzai](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) - BusyBox-like
  (multi-call binary) command composition, recursive tab completion,
  rich embedded command documentation (markdown, formatted, pager-aware,
  color, interactive terminal detection), library of completers (files,
  dates, calculator) and composable commands (help, config)

* [rwxrob/scan](https://github.com/rwxrob/scan) - universal rune
  scanner and optional parser designed for rapid applications
  development without sacrificing performance, batteries included, zero
  function recursion, intuitive methods, optional JSON ASTs, clean
  rooted node tree structure, easy to generate code from PEGN, PEG,
  ABNF, EBNF, regular expressions

* [rwxrob/fn](https://github.com/rwxrob/fn) - map/filter/reduce/each in
  Go with generics, `fn.A` functional array type, library of map
  functions (mapf), map transformations (maps), filters (filt)

* [rwxrob/structs](https://github.com/rwxrob/structs) - traditional data
  structures (list, set, stack, node, tree, etc.) implemented with rapid
  applications development (replacing shell scripts) as design priority

* [rwxrob/term](https://github.com/rwxrob/term) - VT100 ANSI terminal
  escapes, no wasteful function calls just to change colors or terminal
  state, interactive terminal detection, window size queries

* [rwxrob/to](https://github.com/rwxrob/to) - library of converter
  utility functions

* [rwxrob/json](https://github.com/rwxrob/json) - supplements
  `encoding/json`, no unnecessary escapes
